          I received a job offer mid-course, and the
           subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I  honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

       “ I was an EMT for many years
    before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and
    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
    thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
    life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

             “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
       code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
       programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
       theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
       had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
       outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
       could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
       example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
       full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

             Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.
        </h3>
        <p class="review">
           “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress
    which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
    to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
    developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
    attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.
